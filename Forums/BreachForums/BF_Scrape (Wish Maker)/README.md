# ABOUT THIS PERSON...

Look, I'm only providing this on the basis it has "some" good data, I Do not care for the "Karakurt" Dick Rider but since he accuses me of "Stealing work" I do give credit even though I shouldn't. Although his actions are illegal and disruptive I'm still providing them as he has shared them semi-publicly.


Even though I dislike him as he acts like a moron, and claims a lot of nonsense which will not be provided which I'll discuss later. He's tried to claim I steal work, 
Unlike doxbin and shit does I do not do such a thing, Yet he claims I "beg for information" No, I pay, source or come across public-facing info that requires no work.
However like doxbin & BreachForums this fool thinks for whatever reason any sensible person on God's Green earth will leak shit to prove a point. Sorry not a Gaming forum debating tanks or war planes we do not publish TLP-RED/Yellow. Green or White will be published as we see fit to release it.


To make it clear:
Any sensitive data deemed: Too risky to post will not be posted, It maybe teased it maybe not but most of the times it'll remain dormant on or SSDs until we need to supply it to the correct people who can take care of it in a legal fashion which may take 1-10 years we do not give a shit either. It'll stay unknown until it has to be known.



This dick riding Karakurt fan thinks he's brilliant & there's a reason we didn't include POM is IntelBroker, Pom is FTC from Doxbin/BF or whatever. It's not fucking true and we strive to bring you the best. Sorry for the README.md Rant but this data is fine, We wanted you the consumer to know what is being posted & some background of the provider as we see fit.


As you can see his name is in the folder, However it is not anywhere in this readme why? Because it doesn't need to be. He's credited in the titled, blocked on Twitter and purged messages on TG. So we don't care. Have some "Credit" and quit scraping BF my dude.
